# MobileBugBountyAutomation
This project contains the script necessary to automate the certificate and proxy setup to use browser stacks with a local MitM proxy, in this case it is using Burpsuite but could be edited to use any tool.

Simply change the extension to .ps1 on "Script.txt" or copy paste the code into your own powershell script.
